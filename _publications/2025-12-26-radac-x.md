excerpt: '**Jiwoo Park\***, Doeun Lee\*, Wonyoung Kim\*<br><br>Pretrained medical vision–language models achieve strong performance in chest X-ray classification but often underutilize the anatomical structure central to radiological reasoning. We investigate whether anatomical segmentation masks can serve as lightweight visual priors without modifying model architectures or training objectives. Using BiomedCLIP fine-tuned on MIMIC-CXR, we overlay anatomical boundaries from CheXmask onto chest X-ray images and evaluate their effects across training and inference settings.<br><br>[Paper](https://github.com/jiwoo-jus/RADAC-X/blob/main/Anatomical%20Masking%20as%20Lightweight%20Visual%20Priors%20for%20Chest%20X-ray%20Classification.pdf) • [Code](https://github.com/jiwoo-jus/RADAC-X)'
