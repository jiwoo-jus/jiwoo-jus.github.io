excerpt: '**Jiwoo Park**, Ruoqi Liu, Avani Jagdale, Andrew Srisuwananukorn, Jing Zhao, Lang Li, Ping Zhang, Sachin Kumar<br><br>Clinical trial evidence is fragmented across structured registries and unstructured research publications, limiting systematic discovery, comparison, and verification of trials. ClinicalTrialsHub addresses this gap by structuring trial attributes from full-text PubMed articles and integrating them across heterogeneous, cross-referenced data sources. This expands access to structured clinical trial data by 83.8% beyond ClinicalTrials.gov alone. The system further supports natural language search and evidence-grounded question answering with explicit attribution to source documents. A user study with clinicians and clinical researchers demonstrates more comprehensive and efficient trial exploration than existing single-source workflows.<br><br>[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08193) • [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCPxyw7Abh0) • [System Code](https://github.com/jiwoo-jus/clinical-trials-hub) • [Evaluation Code](https://github.com/jiwoo-jus/clinical-trials-hub-evaluation)'
